# Random cocycles

Generator-presented one-sided matrix cocycles over measure-preserving bases,
with finite-time algebra, measurability, maximum-row-sum norm observables, and
extended log norms. A separate real log-positive envelope propagates an
explicit one-step integrability assumption through every finite horizon while
remaining distinct from contraction-sensitive asymptotic growth theory. Its
totalized integrals are invariant under preserved base shifts. Under the same
explicit integrability hypothesis, the integrated sequence is subadditive and
has a deterministic Fekete limit, without assuming probability or ergodicity
and without an almost-sure or Lyapunov conclusion. A final interface layer
separates probability normalization, ergodic rigidity, and finite-time
integrability while packaging the log-positive family as an integrable
subadditive-process candidate. It deliberately stops before Kingman's theorem
or any samplewise exponent claim.
