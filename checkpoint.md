The root aggregator imports all six modules. The proof-to-prose manifest and
`scripts/check_lean_notebook_coverage.py` enforce paired coverage and named
declaration visibility.

## Exact Next Milestone

### RMT-04: independent Cartesian complex Gaussian families

The next module is `NonlinearDynamics.Random.ComplexGaussianFamilies`. It must
lift the checked one-variable law to finite independent coordinates without
quietly assuming missing cross-family independence:

1. Define `IndependentCartesianComplexGaussianFamily Z m vRe vIm P` with
   ordinary measurability for every coordinate, its exact Cartesian complex
   Gaussian law, and `iIndepFun Z P`. Keep both variance functions visible.
2. Expose coordinate a.e. measurability, the probability-measure consequence,
   real and imaginary exact laws and variances, exact complex means, `MemLp`,
   and integrability through the bundle.
3. First prove real scalar multiplication for one exact complex law, then lift
   it coordinatewise. A real scale multiplies both coordinate variances by its
   square and avoids the covariance rotation caused by a general complex
   scale.
4. For finite `ι`, prove the joint law is
   `Measure.pi (fun i ↦ cartesianComplexGaussian (m i) (vRe i) (vIm i))`.
   Define that canonical product measure, prove its probability instance,
   evaluation laws, coordinate independence, and the bundled canonical family.
5. State the empty-index boundary explicitly using `Measure.pi_of_empty`: the
   product is the Dirac mass at the unique empty function. This is still not a
   decision about a zero-dimensional matrix ensemble.
6. Do not construct complex coordinates by pairing two separately independent
   real families: those hypotheses do not supply independence between the two
   families. A later constructor must start from joint block independence.
7. Pair the module with a complete Notebook chapter and Knowledge Base links,
   run strict validation, update this checkpoint, commit, and push to `main`.

This slice will still make no circularity, properness, density,
matrix-ensemble, GUE, unitary-invariance, eigenvalue, matrix-observable
expectation, trace-moment, or asymptotic claim. The GUE normalization,
representation, and zero-dimensional ledgers remain gates after this family
layer.

## Dependency-Ordered Roadmap

The program order is:

1. finish finite random-matrix probability through a checked GUE law and its
   first integrable trace moments;
2. build the common deterministic discrete API, then stability, attraction,
   Lyapunov, conjugacy, chaos, coding, models, and bifurcation;
3. build ODE existence and flow infrastructure before ODE stability,
   Lyapunov theory, and concrete vector fields;
4. develop deterministic matrix products before measurable random products,
   cocycles, Lyapunov growth, and a precisely chosen stochastic-stability
   notion;
5. establish finite-dimensional quantum evolution, states, spectra, and
   empirical spectral measures; and
6. layer spectral statistics, GUE diagnostics, spectral form factors, OTOCs,
   and exact then approximate k-invariance on those foundations.

Later tracks may begin only where their definitions do not silently choose an
unresolved convention or depend on an unproved earlier interface.

  products.

  Lyapunov-growth interfaces.

  exponents.

### Deterministic discrete dynamics

The following files exist only as one-line documentation placeholders:

- [ ] `Discrete/Stability.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Attraction.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Lyapunov.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Conjugacy.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Bifurcation.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/Sensitivity.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/Devaney.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/SymbolicCoding.lean`

### ODEs and concrete models

These files are also placeholders:

- [ ] `ODE/GlobalExistence.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/ToFlow.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/Stability.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/Lyapunov.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LogisticMap.lean`
- [ ] `Models/TentMap.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LogisticODE.lean`
- [ ] `Models/Pendulum.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LotkaVolterra.lean`
- [ ] `Models/Lorenz.lean`

### Quantum chaos

Only placeholder directories currently exist:

- [ ] `QuantumChaos/SpectralStatistics`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/GUE`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/SpectralFormFactor`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/OTOC`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/KInvariance`

Core GUE probability belongs in `Random/RandomMatrices`; the quantum-chaos
track should consume it rather than redefine it.

Before those branches become substantive, add shared finite-dimensional
infrastructure for Hermitian Hamiltonians, matrix-exponential evolution,
normalized trace states, ordered spectra, and measurable empirical spectral
data. Spectral statistics precede GUE specializations; finite-matrix bounds
precede ensemble-averaged spectral form factors and OTOCs; exact moment-operator
k-invariance precedes approximation claims.

## Decision Ledger

- `RandomMatrix` is a carrier map until measurability is proved or bundled.
- The project matrix measurable space is entrywise and currently project-owned.
- Hermitian symmetrization is `X + Xᴴ`, explicitly unnormalized.
- Congruence `AHAᴴ` preserves Hermiticity for arbitrary finite `A`; this is not
  unitary or distributional invariance.
- A matrix law is a pushforward on the full ambient matrix space.
- Unitary invariance means equality of measures under every deterministic
  unitary conjugation.
- Trace powers are measurable observables, not expectations or moments until a
  probability measure and integrability are supplied.
- A real Gaussian primitive is an exact `HasLaw` for `gaussianReal m v` before
  it is treated qualitatively as Gaussian; the `NNReal` parameter is variance,
  and `v = 0` is the Dirac law at the mean.
- `HasLaw` supplies a.e. measurability, not ordinary measurability. The
  independent-family bundle records ordinary coordinate measurability
  separately.
- The empty scalar Gaussian product is the Dirac mass at the unique empty
  tuple. This does not decide the later zero-dimensional matrix policy.
- A Cartesian complex Gaussian law is the product of independent real and
  imaginary Gaussian coordinates. It does not by itself mean circular or
  proper complex Gaussianity.
- Complex Gaussian coordinate variances remain a visible pair `vRe`, `vIm`.
  No single undifferentiated "complex variance" is used, and no symmetric
  choice has been selected as the GUE normalization.
- Qualitative `IsGaussian` for the complex law is over the underlying real
  Banach space. It does not encode circularity, a density, or a matrix law.
- When both coordinate variances vanish, the complex law is Dirac at its mean.
  The one-zero line-supported case is explained in prose but has no named Lean
  theorem yet.
- Separate independence of a real family and an imaginary family is
  insufficient to pair them coordinatewise; the missing cross-family
  independence must never be inferred.
- No GOE/GUE normalization has been selected yet.
- GUE construction has an open representation gate: independent entries are
  convenient for coordinates, while an isotropic Gaussian measure on the real
  Hermitian space makes unitary invariance cleaner. If both are used, their
  equivalence must be proved.
- The candidate Wigner-scaled convention, still unapproved, has diagonal
  variance `1 / n`, off-diagonal real and imaginary variances `1 / (2n)`, and
  an order-one empirical spectrum. The density, trace normalization, and
  zero-dimensional case must agree with that choice.
- The deterministic layer must choose point versus invariant-set stability,
  forward versus two-sided time, and metric versus neighborhood formulations.
- Devaney chaos must record whether sensitivity is assumed or derived under a
  no-isolated-points hypothesis; bifurcation must distinguish an abstract
  topological interface from differentiable normal forms.
- Spectrum work must choose an eigenvalue enumeration or multiset/empirical
  measure interface before defining unfolding.
- `StochasticStability` is currently ambiguous among random-Jacobian bounds,
  persistence of invariant measures under noise, and random attractors.
- Quantum diagnostics must fix raw versus normalized traces, state and unit
  conventions, connected versus unconnected spectral form factors, OTOC order
  and sign, and the norm used for approximate k-invariance.

## Open Risks and Nonclaims

- GUE conventions differ. Do not choose variances or dimension scaling
  implicitly.
- Mathlib's `Measure.map` is total and has fallback behavior outside the
  a.e.-measurable case. Keep measurability evidence explicit.
- Eigenvalue measurability, ordering, multiplicity, and spectral scaling remain
  unformalized.
- Quantum-chaos universality claims are not general theorems in this project.
- The deterministic placeholder tree has no substantive definitions yet.

```

Checkpoint/skill milestone QA:

- official project-skill structural validator: passed;
- fresh-agent forward test: recovered RMT-02, the local API-first workflow,
  proof-to-prose contract, validation gates, and safe push procedure;
- independent repository audit: matched the substantive/placeholder inventory
  and exposed the decision gates now recorded above.
- RMT-02 Lean audit: exact-law and edge-case claims match the checked module,
  every named declaration has paired prose, warnings-as-errors checks pass,
  and no nonstandard axioms or proof holes were introduced.
- RMT-02 teaching audit: all six cards reproduce byte-for-byte, all five SVGs
  parse, KaTeX delimiters balance, Hugo renders 61 pages with warnings fatal,
  and desktop plus mobile browser QA reports no page-level overflow or broken
  rendered assets.
- RMT-03 Lean audit: all 20 public declarations match their exact-law and
  edge-case claims, warnings-as-errors passes for the module and both
  aggregators, the build completes 3,139 jobs, and only Mathlib's standard
  classical axioms appear in the audit.
- RMT-03 teaching audit: the 6,139-word Notebook covers every declaration; the
  new glossary and Deep Dive accurately separate checked Lean from density,
  support, covariance, pseudocovariance, properness, and circularity
  derivations; all three new cards reproduce byte-for-byte; both SVGs parse;
  KaTeX renders; and desktop plus 390-pixel mobile QA reports no page-level
  overflow, broken assets, or browser warnings.
