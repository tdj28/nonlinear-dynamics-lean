## Exact Next Milestone

### RMT-05: deterministic Hermitian coordinate assembly

The next module is
`NonlinearDynamics.Random.RandomMatrices.HermitianCoordinates`. It must isolate
the algebraic and measurable bridge from primitive coordinates to a Hermitian
matrix before any Gaussian or GUE normalization is chosen:

1. Define the opaque finite subtype
   `StrictUpperIndex n := {ij : Fin n × Fin n // ij.1 < ij.2}` with explicit
   `Fintype`, `DecidableEq`, and zero-dimensional emptiness instances. Define
   `HermitianCoordinateSpace n` as a real diagonal paired with a complex
   strict upper triangle.
2. Define `RandomMatrix.hermitianFromCoordinates d u` by a direct three-way
   branch: use `u` above the diagonal, its complex conjugate below the
   diagonal, and the real value `d i` on the diagonal. Do not implement this as
   `X + Xᴴ`, which would double the diagonal and introduce a hidden scale.
3. Prove named diagonal, upper, and lower entry simplification theorems and
   `hermitianFromCoordinates_isHermitian` using entrywise Hermiticity and
   trichotomy of the finite indices.
4. Prove `measurable_hermitianFromCoordinates` from measurable diagonal and
   upper-coordinate processes. Define the canonical `hermitianCoordinateMap`,
   prove it measurable, and bundle measurable processes with
   `HermitianRandomMatrix.ofCoordinates` and its application theorem.
5. Make dimension zero executable in the API: both primitive index types are
   empty, assembly is the unique zero `0 × 0` matrix, and the canonical map is
   zero. This remains normalization-free and prepares the later Dirac matrix
   law without dividing by a dimension.
6. Import the module through `RandomMatrices`, pair all declarations with a
   complete Notebook chapter and Knowledge Base integration, run strict
   validation, update this checkpoint, commit, and push to `main`.

This slice will make no Gaussian-coordinate, independence, matrix-law, GUE,
density, unitary-invariance, eigenvalue, expectation, trace-moment, or
asymptotic claim. RMT-06 will choose an approved dimension-dependent ledger,
put the diagonal and upper coordinates on one canonical product probability
space, and push that measure through this assembly map.

## Dependency-Ordered Roadmap

The program order is:

1. finish finite random-matrix probability through a checked GUE law and its
   first integrable trace moments;
2. build the common deterministic discrete API, then stability, attraction,
   Lyapunov, conjugacy, chaos, coding, models, and bifurcation;
3. build ODE existence and flow infrastructure before ODE stability,
   Lyapunov theory, and concrete vector fields;
4. develop deterministic matrix products before measurable random products,
   cocycles, Lyapunov growth, and a precisely chosen stochastic-stability
   notion;
5. establish finite-dimensional quantum evolution, states, spectra, and
   empirical spectral measures; and
6. layer spectral statistics, GUE diagnostics, spectral form factors, OTOCs,
   and exact then approximate k-invariance on those foundations.

Later tracks may begin only where their definitions do not silently choose an
unresolved convention or depend on an unproved earlier interface.

### Random matrices and random dynamics

- [x] Matrix measurability and algebraic closure.

  products.

  Lyapunov-growth interfaces.

  exponents.

### Deterministic discrete dynamics

The following files exist only as one-line documentation placeholders:

- [ ] `Discrete/Stability.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Attraction.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Lyapunov.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Conjugacy.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Bifurcation.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/Sensitivity.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/Devaney.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/SymbolicCoding.lean`

### ODEs and concrete models

These files are also placeholders:

- [ ] `ODE/GlobalExistence.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/ToFlow.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/Stability.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/Lyapunov.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LogisticMap.lean`
- [ ] `Models/TentMap.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LogisticODE.lean`
- [ ] `Models/Pendulum.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LotkaVolterra.lean`
- [ ] `Models/Lorenz.lean`

### Quantum chaos

Only placeholder directories currently exist:

- [ ] `QuantumChaos/SpectralStatistics`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/GUE`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/SpectralFormFactor`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/OTOC`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/KInvariance`

Core GUE probability belongs in `Random/RandomMatrices`; the quantum-chaos
track should consume it rather than redefine it.

Before those branches become substantive, add shared finite-dimensional
infrastructure for Hermitian Hamiltonians, matrix-exponential evolution,
normalized trace states, ordered spectra, and measurable empirical spectral
data. Spectral statistics precede GUE specializations; finite-matrix bounds
precede ensemble-averaged spectral form factors and OTOCs; exact moment-operator
k-invariance precedes approximation claims.

## Decision Ledger

- `RandomMatrix` is a carrier map until measurability is proved or bundled.
- The project matrix measurable space is entrywise and currently project-owned.
- Hermitian symmetrization is `X + Xᴴ`, explicitly unnormalized.
- Congruence `AHAᴴ` preserves Hermiticity for arbitrary finite `A`; this is not
  unitary or distributional invariance.
- A matrix law is a pushforward on the full ambient matrix space.
- Unitary invariance means equality of measures under every deterministic
  unitary conjugation.
- Trace powers are measurable observables, not expectations or moments until a
  probability measure and integrability are supplied.
- A real Gaussian primitive is an exact `HasLaw` for `gaussianReal m v` before
  it is treated qualitatively as Gaussian; the `NNReal` parameter is variance,
  and `v = 0` is the Dirac law at the mean.
- `HasLaw` supplies a.e. measurability, not ordinary measurability. The
  independent-family bundle records ordinary coordinate measurability
  separately.
- The empty scalar Gaussian product is the Dirac mass at the unique empty
  tuple. This does not decide the later zero-dimensional matrix policy.
- A Cartesian complex Gaussian law is the product of independent real and
  imaginary Gaussian coordinates. It does not by itself mean circular or
  proper complex Gaussianity.
- Complex Gaussian coordinate variances remain a visible pair `vRe`, `vIm`.
  No single undifferentiated "complex variance" is used, and no symmetric
  choice has been selected as the GUE normalization.
- Qualitative `IsGaussian` for the complex law is over the underlying real
  Banach space. It does not encode circularity, a density, or a matrix law.
- When both coordinate variances vanish, the complex law is Dirac at its mean.
  The one-zero line-supported case is explained in prose but has no named Lean
  theorem yet.
- Separate independence of a real family and an imaginary family is
  insufficient to pair them coordinatewise; the missing cross-family
  independence must never be inferred.
- An independent Cartesian complex Gaussian family stores ordinary coordinate
  measurability, exact coordinate laws, and `iIndepFun` as separate evidence.
  Its exact finite joint law is the product of the coordinate laws.
- The honest real-pair constructor requires an exact product law inside each
  pair and mutual independence across the pair-vectors. Separate independence
  of the real and imaginary source families does not establish either global
  block statement.
- Coordinatewise scaling is currently real only. General complex scaling can
  rotate an anisotropic Cartesian law into correlated displayed axes and needs
  covariance-aware bookkeeping.
- The empty Cartesian complex Gaussian product is Dirac at the unique empty
  coordinate function. This still does not select a matrix normalization.
- Hermitian coordinate assembly will use real diagonal values and complex
  strict-upper values directly, reflecting the latter below the diagonal.
  Reusing unnormalized `X + Xᴴ` would double the diagonal and is forbidden for
  that constructor.
- No GOE/GUE normalization has been selected yet.
- GUE construction has an open representation gate: independent entries are
  convenient for coordinates, while an isotropic Gaussian measure on the real
  Hermitian space makes unitary invariance cleaner. If both are used, their
  equivalence must be proved.
- The candidate Wigner-scaled convention, still unapproved, has diagonal
  variance `1 / n`, off-diagonal real and imaginary variances `1 / (2n)`, and
  an order-one empirical spectrum. The density, trace normalization, and
  zero-dimensional case must agree with that choice.
- The deterministic layer must choose point versus invariant-set stability,
  forward versus two-sided time, and metric versus neighborhood formulations.
- Devaney chaos must record whether sensitivity is assumed or derived under a
  no-isolated-points hypothesis; bifurcation must distinguish an abstract
  topological interface from differentiable normal forms.
- Spectrum work must choose an eigenvalue enumeration or multiset/empirical
  measure interface before defining unfolding.
- `StochasticStability` is currently ambiguous among random-Jacobian bounds,
  persistence of invariant measures under noise, and random attractors.
- Quantum diagnostics must fix raw versus normalized traces, state and unit
  conventions, connected versus unconnected spectral form factors, OTOC order
  and sign, and the norm used for approximate k-invariance.

## Open Risks and Nonclaims

- GUE conventions differ. Do not choose variances or dimension scaling
  implicitly.
- Mathlib's `Measure.map` is total and has fallback behavior outside the
  a.e.-measurable case. Keep measurability evidence explicit.
- Eigenvalue measurability, ordering, multiplicity, and spectral scaling remain
  unformalized.
- Quantum-chaos universality claims are not general theorems in this project.
- The deterministic placeholder tree has no substantive definitions yet.
