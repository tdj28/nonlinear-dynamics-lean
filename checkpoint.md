## Exact Next Milestone

### RMT-06: the finite-dimensional GUE coordinate and matrix laws

The next module is
`NonlinearDynamics.Random.RandomMatrices.GaussianUnitaryEnsemble`, in namespace
`NonlinearDynamics.Random.GUE`. It will make the first dimension-dependent
normalization choice and push one canonical product measure through the checked
RMT-05 assembly map:

1. Define a total, explicit variance scale by pattern matching:
   `varianceScale 0 = 0` and `varianceScale (n + 1) = (n + 1)⁻¹` in `ℝ≥0`.
   Set diagonal variance to `1 / n` and each displayed real/imaginary
   strict-upper variance to `1 / (2n)` for positive `n`. Prove named zero and
   successor formulas instead of reasoning through division by zero.
2. Define `GUE.coordinateMeasure n` as the product of the finite real Gaussian
   diagonal law and the finite Cartesian complex Gaussian strict-upper law.
   Prove it is a probability measure and expose exact laws for both blocks.
3. Prove independence of the two blocks, exact scalar diagonal and upper laws,
   mutual independence within each block, and cross-block coordinate
   independence. Keep ordinary measurability and exact `HasLaw` evidence
   explicit throughout.
4. Define `GUE.matrixLaw n` as the measurable pushforward of
   `coordinateMeasure n` through `hermitianCoordinateMap n`. Prove its map
   formula and probability instance, then transfer exact diagonal and
   strict-upper entry marginals to the assembled matrix.
5. Make `n = 0` executable: prove the coordinate law is Dirac at the unique
   empty coordinate point and the matrix law is Dirac at the unique zero
   matrix.
6. Pair every public declaration with a complete Notebook chapter and extend
   the Knowledge Base with the normalization ledger, product-space
   construction, independence architecture, pushforward law, and explicit
   nonclaims. Run strict validation, update this checkpoint, commit, and push.

For positive `n`, this convention corresponds to the unnormalized matrix-trace
density `exp (-n * Tr(H^2) / 2)` and order-one Wigner spectral scale. RMT-06
will not claim a density theorem, Hermitian support at the measure level,
unitary invariance, eigenvalue measurability, semicircle behavior, expectation,
or trace moments. RMT-07 will build the real-linear Hermitian geometry needed
for density, support, and nontrivial unitary-conjugation invariance.

## Dependency-Ordered Roadmap

The program order is:

1. finish finite random-matrix probability through a checked GUE law and its
   first integrable trace moments;
2. build the common deterministic discrete API, then stability, attraction,
   Lyapunov, conjugacy, chaos, coding, models, and bifurcation;
3. build ODE existence and flow infrastructure before ODE stability,
   Lyapunov theory, and concrete vector fields;
4. develop deterministic matrix products before measurable random products,
   cocycles, Lyapunov growth, and a precisely chosen stochastic-stability
   notion;
5. establish finite-dimensional quantum evolution, states, spectra, and
   empirical spectral measures; and
6. layer spectral statistics, GUE diagnostics, spectral form factors, OTOCs,
   and exact then approximate k-invariance on those foundations.

Later tracks may begin only where their definitions do not silently choose an
unresolved convention or depend on an unproved earlier interface.

### Deterministic discrete dynamics

The following files exist only as one-line documentation placeholders:

- [ ] `Discrete/Stability.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Attraction.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Lyapunov.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Conjugacy.lean`
- [ ] `Discrete/Bifurcation.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/Sensitivity.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/Devaney.lean`
- [ ] `Chaos/SymbolicCoding.lean`

### ODEs and concrete models

These files are also placeholders:

- [ ] `ODE/GlobalExistence.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/ToFlow.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/Stability.lean`
- [ ] `ODE/Lyapunov.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LogisticMap.lean`
- [ ] `Models/TentMap.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LogisticODE.lean`
- [ ] `Models/Pendulum.lean`
- [ ] `Models/LotkaVolterra.lean`
- [ ] `Models/Lorenz.lean`

### Quantum chaos

Only placeholder directories currently exist:

- [ ] `QuantumChaos/SpectralStatistics`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/GUE`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/SpectralFormFactor`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/OTOC`
- [ ] `QuantumChaos/KInvariance`

Core GUE probability belongs in `Random/RandomMatrices`; the quantum-chaos
track should consume it rather than redefine it.

Before those branches become substantive, add shared finite-dimensional
infrastructure for Hermitian Hamiltonians, matrix-exponential evolution,
normalized trace states, ordered spectra, and measurable empirical spectral
data. Spectral statistics precede GUE specializations; finite-matrix bounds
precede ensemble-averaged spectral form factors and OTOCs; exact moment-operator
k-invariance precedes approximation claims.

## Decision Ledger

- `RandomMatrix` is a carrier map until measurability is proved or bundled.
- The project matrix measurable space is entrywise and currently project-owned.
- Hermitian symmetrization is `X + Xᴴ`, explicitly unnormalized.
- Congruence `AHAᴴ` preserves Hermiticity for arbitrary finite `A`; this is not
  unitary or distributional invariance.
- A matrix law is a pushforward on the full ambient matrix space.
- Unitary invariance means equality of measures under every deterministic
  unitary conjugation.
- Trace powers are measurable observables, not expectations or moments until a
  probability measure and integrability are supplied.
- A real Gaussian primitive is an exact `HasLaw` for `gaussianReal m v` before
  it is treated qualitatively as Gaussian; the `NNReal` parameter is variance,
  and `v = 0` is the Dirac law at the mean.
- `HasLaw` supplies a.e. measurability, not ordinary measurability. The
  independent-family bundle records ordinary coordinate measurability
  separately.
- The empty scalar Gaussian product is the Dirac mass at the unique empty
  tuple. This does not decide the later zero-dimensional matrix policy.
- A Cartesian complex Gaussian law is the product of independent real and
  imaginary Gaussian coordinates. It does not by itself mean circular or
  proper complex Gaussianity.
- Complex Gaussian coordinate variances remain a visible pair `vRe`, `vIm`.
  No single undifferentiated "complex variance" is used, and no symmetric
  choice has been selected as the GUE normalization.
- Qualitative `IsGaussian` for the complex law is over the underlying real
  Banach space. It does not encode circularity, a density, or a matrix law.
- When both coordinate variances vanish, the complex law is Dirac at its mean.
  The one-zero line-supported case is explained in prose but has no named Lean
  theorem yet.
- Separate independence of a real family and an imaginary family is
  insufficient to pair them coordinatewise; the missing cross-family
  independence must never be inferred.
- An independent Cartesian complex Gaussian family stores ordinary coordinate
  measurability, exact coordinate laws, and `iIndepFun` as separate evidence.
  Its exact finite joint law is the product of the coordinate laws.
- The honest real-pair constructor requires an exact product law inside each
  pair and mutual independence across the pair-vectors. Separate independence
  of the real and imaginary source families does not establish either global
  block statement.
- Coordinatewise scaling is currently real only. General complex scaling can
  rotate an anisotropic Cartesian law into correlated displayed axes and needs
  covariance-aware bookkeeping.
- The empty Cartesian complex Gaussian product is Dirac at the unique empty
  coordinate function. This still does not select a matrix normalization.
- Hermitian coordinate assembly uses real diagonal values and complex
  strict-upper values directly, reflecting the latter below the diagonal.
  Reusing unnormalized `X + Xᴴ` would double the diagonal and is forbidden for
  that constructor.
- At `n = 0`, both Hermitian coordinate blocks are empty and direct assembly is
  the unique zero matrix. RMT-05 intentionally adds no inverse map or dimension
  theorem.
- The approved RMT-06 GUE convention is Wigner scaled: diagonal variance
  `1 / n`, displayed off-diagonal real and imaginary variances `1 / (2n)`,
  unnormalized matrix trace, density exponent `-n Tr(H^2) / 2`, and an
  order-one spectrum. Its total zero-dimensional scale is defined explicitly
  as zero.
- GUE construction has an open representation gate: independent entries are
  convenient for coordinates, while an isotropic Gaussian measure on the real
  Hermitian space makes unitary invariance cleaner. If both are used, their
  equivalence must be proved.
- The density identity and order-one spectral interpretation remain explanatory
  context until their prerequisites are formalized. RMT-06 proves only the
  exact coordinate and matrix laws induced by the approved variance ledger.
- The deterministic layer must choose point versus invariant-set stability,
  forward versus two-sided time, and metric versus neighborhood formulations.
- Devaney chaos must record whether sensitivity is assumed or derived under a
  no-isolated-points hypothesis; bifurcation must distinguish an abstract
  topological interface from differentiable normal forms.
- Spectrum work must choose an eigenvalue enumeration or multiset/empirical
  measure interface before defining unfolding.
- `StochasticStability` is currently ambiguous among random-Jacobian bounds,
  persistence of invariant measures under noise, and random attractors.
- Quantum diagnostics must fix raw versus normalized traces, state and unit
  conventions, connected versus unconnected spectral form factors, OTOC order
  and sign, and the norm used for approximate k-invariance.

## Open Risks and Nonclaims

- GUE conventions differ. Keep the approved variance, trace, density-exponent,
  and zero-dimensional ledger explicit in code and prose.
- Mathlib's `Measure.map` is total and has fallback behavior outside the
  a.e.-measurable case. Keep measurability evidence explicit.
- Eigenvalue measurability, ordering, multiplicity, and spectral scaling remain
  unformalized.
- Quantum-chaos universality claims are not general theorems in this project.
- The deterministic placeholder tree has no substantive definitions yet.
